			<b>Collection of Information </b><br />
			<br />
			By using EenmaalAndermaal's online sites, products, and services, users agree that EenmaalAndermaal may collect personally identifiable information (as defined below).  EenmaalAndermaal will not share personally identifiable information with other parties except as described in this policy. EenmaalAndermaal may also collect aggregate information and individual information.   "Aggregate information" is information that describes the habits, usage patterns, and demographics of users as a group but does not describe or reveal the identity of any particular user. "Individual information" is information about a user or user’s machine that is presented in a form distinguishable from information relating to other users but not in a form that personally identifies any user or enables the recipient to communicate directly with any user. EenmaalAndermaal may share aggregate and individual information with other parties without restriction.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Personally Identifiable Information</b><br />
			<br />
			"Personally identifiable information" is information that can be used to uniquely identify a user, such as name, address or credit card number.   You may be asked to provide personally identifiable information in connection with the use of EenmaalAndermaal’s products, services and online sites. While EenmaalAndermaal collects personally identifiable information on a voluntary basis, for certain products and services EenmaalAndermaal's collection of personally identifiable information may be a requirement for access to the product or service or to process a user’s order.  <br />
			<br />
			<b>Use of Personally Identifiable Information</b><br />
			<br />
			Personally identifiable information is used internally by EenmaalAndermaal to develop, deliver and improve our products,content and services. In addition, EenmaalAndermaal may allow third parties performing services under contract with EenmaalAndermaal, such as order or payment processors or merchandise warehouse and fulfillment services, to access and use personally identifiable information, but only to the extent necessary to provide those services. <br />
			<br />
			EenmaalAndermaal will not share personally identifying information with third parties for marketing purposes.  EenmaalAndermaal may use personally identifying information provided by users to send information about EenmaalAndermaal, including news about product updates, contests, events, and other promotional materials, but only if the users agree to receive such communications.<br />
			<br />
			In some situations, personally identifiable information that users input in connection with their use of EenmaalAndermaal may be available to other users of EenmaalAndermaal. For example, during the creation of a EenmaalAndermaal account, EenmaalAndermaal collects a user's email address and username, and at the user's option, first and last name.  Some of this information is searchable and available to other users within EenmaalAndermaal. EenmaalAndermaal has no obligation to keep private personally identifiable information that a user makes available to other users via EenmaalAndermaal or other EenmaalAndermaal software, such as in multiplayer chat or other public functions. <br />
